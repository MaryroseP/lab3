            <p><strong><u>Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie.</u></strong> Marie Curie is my most favorite female historical figure. Her life was very interesting
            to read about. It gave me motivation to keep pursuing everything that I was passionate about with full focus. Her work ethic is something
        that people should adopt, including me. Her tragic life is an inspiration that nothing will get in the way of a strong and intelligent woman.
